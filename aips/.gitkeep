# AIPs directory
# Agentic Implementation Plans live here

This directory contains your project's AIPs (Agentic Implementation Plans).

## Usage

Create a new AIP:
```bash
spec create --tier C --title "My task" --owner yourname
```

This generates a file like `aips/my-task.yaml` that you can edit, validate, and execute.
